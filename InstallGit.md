# Install Git

[Here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
is Git's own website describing how to install it.
Below are additional details for SCOREC:

## Linux

Your Linux package manager should have
a Git package, as well as a package
including `make` and other such developer
tools.
Install them both and you're good to go.

## Mac

Success has been found by installing the OS X
Command Line Developer Tools, as they
are much smaller than the overall XCode app.
Apparently, you can trigger this by simply
opening your Terminal app and typing
`git`, `gcc`, or any other command line name.
This should prompt you to install them
if they are not already, and guide
you through the process.
You will also get `make` through this
install, which we will be using
in the [compilation tutorial](Compile.md).

## Windows

Although succcess has been found with
Git on Windows, we'll omit instructions
here for lack of success with a
fully integrated LaTeX install on Windows.
